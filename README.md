# responsive-portfolio

In this project, I took my [basic portfolio](https://bill-basic-portfolio.herokuapp.com/) and converted it to be responsive to different widths by using media queries.

My goal with this project was to practice having to create a site for a client based on their exact design, so I challenged myself to create a pixel-perfect copy of the below designs.  Here is my site: [heroku link](https://bill-responsive-portfolio.herokuapp.com/).  How did I do?
